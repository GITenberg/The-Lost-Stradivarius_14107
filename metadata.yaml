description: "The Lost Stradivarius (1895), by J. Meade Falkner, is a short novel\
  \ of ghosts and the evil that can be invested in an object, in this case an extremely\
  \ fine Stradivarius violin. After finding the violin of the title in a hidden compartment\
  \ in his college rooms, the protagonist, a wealthy young heir, becomes increasingly\
  \ secretive as well as obsessed by a particular piece of music, which seems to have\
  \ the power to call up the ghost of the violin's previous owner. Roaming from England\
  \ to Italy, the story involves family love, lordly depravity, and the tragedy of\
  \ obsession, all conveyed in a \"high\" serious tone not uncommon in late Victorian\
  \ literature. Preceding M.R. James's ghost stories by several years, it has been\
  \ called the novel James might have written, had he written novels.\nIn August 2008,\
  \ a Joanna David reading of the novel was broadcast on BBC Radio 7.\n From Wikipedia\
